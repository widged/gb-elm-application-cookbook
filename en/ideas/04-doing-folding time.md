# Folding Time

The caterpillar wants to move on its own. Help it move in a straight line.
It will eventually fall off the screen. Tell it to turn around once it reaches the edge.
Try to retain the wave motion.

You will need:
* [`Signal.foldp`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/1.1.0/Signal#foldp)
* tuples or [records](http://elm-lang.org/learn/Syntax.elm#records)
