# Advanced: My Little Pong

Install the [Elm Platform](http://elm-lang.org/Install.elm). Make a Pong game where the ponies Luna and Celestia pass a ball back and forth.

## Building blocks

* Luna and Celestia pngs and in-code objects
* a ball-type in-code object (circle)
* code to move them with keys
* a playing field
